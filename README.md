## Project Decription
Classified: Project Nikaky is a text-based choose your own adventure game set in 3035 where the unfortunate effects of Global Warming have made the Earth inhabitable and humans have occupied space. However, hope arrives when you discover a deactivated time machine created by 3 scientists, Dr. Juliene Palada PhD., Dr. Chrismyshell Maristela PhD., and Dr. Kaleena So PhD. in 2022 within the grounds of the Philippine Science High School - Main Campus. 

This machine will allow you to travel to the past, warning the world before these unfortunate events take place. Thus, the government sends you and other engineers on a mission to get the machine working. Hidden within the school corridors is the reactivation key to the time machine you must uncover before your time runs out due to the limited supply of oxygen. 

The reactivation key requires a set of codes hidden within the school which can be obtained by answering some questions. These questions will be about certain STEM topics taught in the school and school trivia. 

A dark, abandoned place will be a challenge for you and your team; thus, the right decisions and answers are crucial. Good luck in saving the future, Engr. 

## Reason behind the Project
We mainly wanted something sci-fi or post-apocalyptic themed set on the grounds of PSHS-MC, incorporating our passion and common interest in STEM with a sci-fi setting. We brainstormed for a plot until we arrived at time-traveling, and eventually came to the idea of sending messages calling to help the Earth would be the main objective of the characters. This is applicable in todayâ€™s society as warnings from scientists help shape our future. As future women in STEM, we felt that trust in science and data is a relevant topic that would fit well for our project, as well as implement a fun and engaging game centered around time travel.
